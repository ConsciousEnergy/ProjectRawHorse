## 🎯 Next Steps for v0.3.0

### Priority 1: Build Cross-Platform Executables
**Goal:** True 1-click install (no Python/Node.js required)

**Tasks:**
1. Configure PyInstaller for backend bundling
2. Bundle React build with Python executable
3. Create platform-specific installers:
   - Windows: `.exe` with installer
   - macOS: `.app` bundle + `.dmg`
   - Linux: `.AppImage`
4. Test on fresh machines
5. Setup GitHub Actions for automated builds

**Benefit:** Removes biggest adoption barrier

---

### Priority 2: Financial Visualizations
**Goal:** Money flow graph with weighted edges

**Tasks:**
1. Create weighted edge visualization for money flows
2. Color by transaction amount
3. Add flow animation
4. Implement timeline charts (awards over time)
5. Add statistical dashboards

**Benefit:** Enhanced analysis capabilities

---

### Priority 3: Additional Features
- Advanced search (full-text across entities)
- Export graph visualizations (PNG/SVG)
- More data sources integration
- Performance optimizations
